# Unit_Converter

Hello everyone, this is my first android project using kotlin in android studio. Through this project I am trying to expand my android development 
and potentialy grow. 

About app:
Using basic tools in android studio and kotlin, app is meant to have a few sections that are used to calculate/convert different measurment units like meters to 
kilometers, liters to deciliters etc. 

In the future I am looking into making more features that will benefit users in their everyday life such as writing dimensions of certain objects and calculating their 
volume, mass...


Thank you for looking into this project and feel free to contact me if you have any questions :)
